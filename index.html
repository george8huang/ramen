              This website will be dedicated to all the ramen places that I have
              visited in Seattle, Washington. I'm sure that you guys will be
              familiar with a few of the places I have listed, but it is my
              goal to show you at least one place that you have yet to try!

            Before we get into it, we should consider: what counts as ramen?
            Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish which comprises of five core
            ingredients:

          <section class="hidden" id="broth-info">
            <h3>Broth</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              This is the soup and foundation of ramen. Base ingredients include
              chicken, pork, seafood, and vegetables. Clear soups, found in shio
              and shoyu ramen, are created in low temperatures, while "white
              soups", found in tonkotsu and tori, are created in high temperatures.
            </p>

          <section class="hidden" id="sauce-info">
            <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              Sauce provides the salt and umami for the broth. Common ingredients
              include soy sauce, wine, sake, kelp, sardines, miso, and salt.
              Ultimately, the sauce is what provides the depth of flavor we enjoy
              in a good bowl of ramen.
            </p>

          <section class="hidden" id="noodles-info">
            <h3>Noodles</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              Noodles are made from water and wheat, which creates the noodle
              shape, and alkaline water, which gives it texture and color.
              The balance of these ingredients must be perfect for good ramen,
              which is why many restaurants prefer to buy their noodles rather
              than take on the challenge.
            </p>

          <section class="hidden" id="toppings-info">
            <h3>Toppings</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              Toppings give each bowl of ramen a delightful set of accents to help
              it appeal to any kind of customer. Common toppings include chashu,
              green onions, bamboo shoots, seaweed, and a marinated egg.

          <section class="hidden" id="oil-info">
            <h3>Oil</h3>
            <p class="desc">
              On its own, oil doesn't seem like the most important or appealing
              aspect, but it's actually quite necessary. Oil helps elevate all
              the other flavors in the broth. In addition, it gives the noodles
              a smooth, slippery texture and keeps the ramen warm for us.
